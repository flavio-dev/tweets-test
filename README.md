# Tictrac Javascript Developer Test

## Brief

Using the provided HTML skeleton you will be required to replicate the given design. For the purpose of this test we will only require the page to work in the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox. The layout has already been styled for you.

The design illustrates how a list of tweets should be presented, you will need to markup and style these tweets.


We have included an array of tweet objects in (`data.js`) , you should use this array to dynamically populate the page content. The 5 latest tweets should be displayed on page load.

Links in tweets should be clickable as per the design.

The tweet dates should be displayed as relative (`5 days ago`) by default. On hover the corresponding absolute date will be displayed (`20th January 2014`).

You will implement a preference toggle that will allow the user to change between absolute and relative dates by default. Changing the toggle will update all displayed tweets instantly and this change should persist on page refresh.

---------------------------------------

**You have 1 hour**, we do not expect you to be able to complete the full test. Take your time and relax, work as you would normally. And feel free to use Google if you need to research something, we all do.

**Good luck!**
